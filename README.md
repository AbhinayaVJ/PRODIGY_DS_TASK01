This data visualization project aims to explore the distribution of ages within a population using a bar chart. The dataset used for this visualization contains age information for a sample population. Each bar represents a specific age group, and the height of the bar indicates the frequency or count of individuals belonging to that age group.

Understanding the age distribution of a population is crucial for various demographic analyses and decision-making processes in areas such as healthcare, marketing, and social policy planning. By visualizing the distribution of ages, we gain insights into the demographic makeup of the population, identify trends, and inform strategies tailored to specific age groups.

This visualization provides a clear and intuitive representation of the age distribution, allowing stakeholders to grasp key insights at a glance. It serves as a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making and further exploration of demographic patterns within the population.
